KC85/1 KC87 Z9001 with MegaROM

Memory Map
Kernel
0000-3FFF	Writable common space, buffers, etc
4000-7FFF	Kernel code (one of the two banks here)
8000-BFFF	User
C000-E7FF	MegaROM banked
E800-EFFF	Video etc
F000-FFFF	ROM

User
0000-3FFF	Kernel
4000-7FFF	User code (other bank)
8000-BFFF	User
C000-E7FF	User	(or ROM if banking out not supported)
E800-EFFF	Video etc
F000-FFFF	ROM

I/O

GIDE at 0x50
RAMdisk at 0x20/0x24

ROM routines used

F03C	set I/O byte (called early)		TODO
F006	const	(then fix up return to be 0/FF)
F009	conin
F00F	list					TODO
F02D	listst					TODO

Interrupts tbd - CP/M uses E7xx, IM2
reti must be above 0x4000 ?	(clarify rule)

CTC 3 0xC7 40
CTC 0 seems to be beep related and a pio bit
	CTC 0 96, in PIO1AD set bit 7 out
		end been wityh res bit 7 CTC 3
	2 chains into 3

ROM assumptions
-
	IM2
	I = 2
	PIO	vector 0 (A/B)
	CTC	vector 0 (ctc 0 is not used for interrupts, 3 is)
	CTC	inti is 40 96


TODO
-	Sort out banked maths routines for CHS mode
-	Figure out how to do a timer interrupt
-	Video colour support
-	Optimised user copies
-	Figure out ramdisk detect
-	Ramdisk debug
-	Floppies
-	Support for RAM to C000 or RAM to E7FF (depends on systems having
	a way to bank out MegaROM)
-	Setups where 0x8000-0xBFFF also vanishes if you page out the RAM for
	the ROM
-	Printer
-	Joysticks
-	Sound (eventually)
-	512K setup (different build altogether but needs a usable emulator)
-	60-6F RTC option
-	Bitbang SD
-	Bitmap graphics
-	KCnet
