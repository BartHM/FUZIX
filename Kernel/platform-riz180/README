RIZ180

A smaller Z180 setup than usual with only 128K ROM and 128K RAM. Fuzix lives
in ROM on this port.

At the moment the port just boots into Fuzix but it would be easy to add some
code to flip to the upper 64K of the ROM and run a monitor or other tools
such as a ROM based CP/M environment. Fuzix however has to live in the low 64K
so the CBAR can be set up to 1:1 map low memory as the ROM image.

Required:
- RIZ180

Options:
TODO - SD card on SPI
TODO - Wiznet 5500 on SPI

This needs a bit of thought as the RIZ180 doesn't have any GPIO ports for the
CS line and the Z180 has no other way to recover bitsync on CSIO.

To set up

make diskimage
Write the disk.img file to disk
Burn the ROM to the flash

The root filesystem device can be specified as either a decimal number, or as a
a device name (without the /dev prefix); hda, hdb, hda1, hda2, etc.

TODO:
- Recheck serial tables for slower clock
- Can we do CF with DMA1 ?

Our memory layout:

00:000	Kernel: low 56K ROM bank 0
0E:000	Kernel: initial image of kernel data and common
10:000	Free 64K

RAM low 16K is kernel
40:000
Then 2 x 56K process windows including a 4K common
	(we end up with one 8K repeated chunk)
44:000
51:000	Common
52:000
5F:000	Common

We run with
Low 52K switched, high 4K common copies
In kernel we run
Low 48K direct map 12K paged, 4K common
