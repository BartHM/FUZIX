Z80 2063

A fairly simple 32/32 banked 512K RAM machine with the usual top bank pinned
high. Has an SIO and CTC and yet another varianr on bitbang SD that's not
the same as anyone else's. Slightly odd boot arrangement (it loads 16K
from the start of partition 1). We subvert it by making the first 512
bytes of our partition boot block just load the kernel from the proper
place instead.

Boot loader only supports SDHC/SDXC cards in large block mode as that
is all the ROM supports.

TODO

SIO - switch to IM2 driver
CTC - wire up IM2 vectors

More messages in boot.s ?
Printer port (sadly SEL seems to be wired low so we can't I suspect
do zip drives)
