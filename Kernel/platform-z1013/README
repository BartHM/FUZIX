An initial cut at Fuzix for the Z1013 with a 32K switchable EPROM. The OS
image is mostly in the ROM and paged in and out as needed. The rest of it
(which must match build) is loaded off the first sectors of the disk which
expects to have a PC style partition table.

(Figuring out how to nicely play with CP/A is a project for later)

Currently assumes
- 32K switchable EPROM (no option to use 128K RAM modern setup)
- GIDE
- RTC (on the GIDE)

TODO
- RAM floppies
- Optional SD card bitbanged on port A
- Optional external timer interrupt on
  port A.
- Video mode switching (64 x 16 optional 64 x 32)
- Floppies
- Look at what other K1520 bits are relevant

Note that the system does not a standard interval timer interrupt so is somewhat
limited by this behaviour. They keyboard is also "interesting" depending upon
the option chosen.

Memory map

User mode
0000-00FF		Monitor space
0100-5FFF		Common, kernel data, buffers, etc
6000-EAFF		User space
E800-EFFF		Video (64 x 32 option)
F000-FFFF		Monitor ROM (jump table required)


Kernel mode
0100-5FFF		Common, kernel data, buffers, etc
8000-E7FF		ROM fuzix code
E800-EFFF		Video (64 x 32 option)
F000-FFFF		Monitor ROM (jump table required)

The system runs with single process in memory for obvious reasons
